Dynamic String Manipulation

   These two functions are dynamic versions of strcpy and strcat. They use malloc for
   allocating space for the string. If StrAllocCopy is called with a non-NULL dest, then
   this is freed before the new value is assigned so that only the last string created has
   to be freed by the user. If StrAllocCat is called with a NULL pointer as destination
   then it is equivalent to StrAllocCopy.

String Comparison with Wild Card Match

   String comparison function for file names with one wildcard * in the template.
   Arguments are:
   
  tmpl                   is a template string to match the name against.  agaist, may
                         contain a single wildcard character * which matches zero or more
                         arbitrary characters.
                         
  name                   is the name to be matched agaist the template.
                         
   Returns empty string ("") if perfect match, pointer to part matched by wildcard if any,
   or NULL if no match. This is basically the same as YES if match, else NO.
