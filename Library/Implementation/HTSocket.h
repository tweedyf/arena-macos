Create an Input Buffer

   This function allocates a input buffer and binds it to the socket descriptor given as
   parameter. The size of the buffer, INPUT_BUFFER_SIZE, is a compromise between speed and
   memory. Here it is chosen as the default TCP High Water Mark (sb_hiwat) for receiving

Load Data from a Socket

   This function is a wrapper around the HTSocketRead()declared below. It provides a
   callback function for the event loop so that a socket can be loaded using non-blocking
   I/O. The function requires an opensocket. It will typically be used in server
   applications or in a client application that can read directly from stdin.

Read Data from a Socket

   This function has replaced many other functions for doing read from a socket. It
   automatically converts from ASCII if we are on a NON-ASCII machine. This assumes that
   we do not use this function to read a local file on a NON-ASCII machine. The following
   type definition is to make life easier when having a state machine looking for a <CRLF>
